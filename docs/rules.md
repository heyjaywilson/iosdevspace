# Rules

1. Be Polite. Don't be rude to anyone. That's not welcome here. If someone is rude, then please let @heyjaywilson know.
2. Discrimination & Bigotry Wonâ€™t Be Tolerated. We're not a free speech absolutist. We're not interested in Nazis, TERFS, or hate speech. No homophobia, transphobia, queerphobia, racism allowed. If you see it, report it. It won't be tolerated on this instance.
3. Use content warnings Be considerate and use content warnings if you think the content will be triggering to others. This just helps keep the server nice for everyone. Things that need a content warning: anything NSFW.
